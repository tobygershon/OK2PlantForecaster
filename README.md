The OK 2 Plant Forecaster returns a forecast day after which planting a vegetable garden is safe.

In Spring many gardeners are eagerly checking the upcoming temperature forecasts to determine when they are able to safely plant specific types of vegetable, fruit, and herb plants and seeds.  Planting before a cold snap can result in poor germination of seeds, permanent damage to crop yields, or dead plants.

The Ok 2 Plant Forecaster takes in a user's location-dependent weather forecast and returns the an OK 2 Plant date, as well as other information like an ideal planting date based on precipitation forecasts and a warning for cold tolerant plants if the weather forecast looks to be too hot for them to thrive.

The application also gives the option to print a 14 day forecast as well as an option to get a location's average last-frost date.
